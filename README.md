# lbu-bb-uploadmonitor
This is a Blackboard Building Block which monitors user uploads to the Xythos content management sub-system. Certain files will trigger the sending of an email message to the user.
This tool was created to inform users that they should not upload huge video files and direct them to use alternate video hosting services instead.
